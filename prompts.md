## Prompt Engineering Strategy

To improve realism and reduce robotic tone:

- Removed generic phrases like "Trust me"
- Avoided overuse of brand name
- Used POV and storytelling format
- Focused on emotions instead of direct selling
- Applied ad structure: Problem → Solution → Experience → CTA

This makes the output feel more authentic and less like AI-generated content.
